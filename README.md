Development of Coupling Tool for Hydro_AS-2D and MODFLOW


This is the information screen of this Master Thesis done by Samed Zeytinci.



1. Preprocessing: Create both HydroAS and MODFLOW models. For MODFLOW, enable Newton-Raphson formulation.

2. Run HydroAS with its application for a short time. It creates hydro_as-2d.inp file which we will modify during our coupling loops.
